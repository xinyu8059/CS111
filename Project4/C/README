lab4c-tcp.c 
	Builds and runs on a Beaglebone. Based on a temperature sensor application.
	Accepts the following parameters:
	--period=#
	--scale= ('C' or 'F')
	--id=9-digit-number (mandatory)
	--host=name or address (mandatory)
	--log=filename (mandatory)
	port number (mandatory)

	Note that there is no --port= in front of the port number. This is a 
	non-switch parameter.

	Opens a TCP connection to the server at the specified address and port
	immediately send (and log) an ID terminated with a newline:
	ID=ID-number. This new report enables the server to keep track of which
	devices it has received reports from. Send (and log) newline terminated
	temperature reports over the connections. Process (and log) newline-
	terminated commands received over the connection. If temperature reports 
	are mis-formatted, the server will return a LOG command with a description 
	of the error. The last command sent by the server will be an OFF.

lab4b-tls.c
	Builds and runs on a Beaglebone. 
	Based on the remote logging appliance built from lab4c-tcp.c, operates by:
	1. opening a TLS connection to the server at the specified address and port
	2. sending (and logging) a student ID followed by a newline
	3. sending (and logging) temperature reports over the connection
	4. processing (and logging) commands received over the connection

Makefile
	3 targets: 
	default ... build both versions of the program
	clean ... delete all programs and output created by the Makefile and restore the directory to its freshly untarred state.
	dist ... create the deliverable tarball.
